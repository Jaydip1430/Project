        <p>As the name suggests, the stainless steel round bar is a class of product created from various grades of
            stainless steel. They can be utilised in a variety of sectors depending on the stainless steel grades.
            Due
            to the high chromium content, these round bars are very strong and efficiently resist corrosion. Because
            of
            their durability and ability to resist corrosion, stainless steel bars are widely used worldwide and we at
            Farmson Engineers are the Leading stainless steel round bar manufacturer in India.</p>
        <p>The grade of the materials and the application requirements determine how bars and rods are used. The
            production and application types are also specified by several specifications based on which wire rod
            manufacturers in India make round bars</p>

                        <p>Stainless steel bars are widely used in most engineering industries like automotive, textile,
                            fabrication, construction, cement, ship building, paper and pulp, defence, heavy earth
                            moving
                            equipment or aerospace. Stainless steel metal alloy consists of 10% of chromium and 1% of
                            carbon
                            which makes it more durable and resistant to corrosion and SS wire rod manufacturers India
                            make
                            rods with this metal alloy</p>
